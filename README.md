# import-dxf-polygonfills
EAGLE ULP for importing vector graphics - with polygon fill option

## Usage

1. Load `import-dxf-polygonfills.ulp`  to Eagle, then you will find "Fill Polygon" option in the middle.
2. Choose "Fill" to import all polylines as polygon in dxf.
   * If you choose "Line Only", the script behaves completely same as original.

## Note

I do not guarantee the results. Polygons with arcs and command line mode haven't been tested yet.
